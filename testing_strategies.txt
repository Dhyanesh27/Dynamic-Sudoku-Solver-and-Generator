Here are the manual testing strategies for your project, now numbered for clarity:

1. Verified that the application window opened and displayed the Sudoku grid correctly.
2. Checked that the "Generate" button created a new, valid Sudoku puzzle each time.
3. Clicked on cells to select them and confirmed that the selection was highlighted.
4. Entered numbers into cells in input mode and ensured only valid entries were accepted.
5. Attempted to enter invalid numbers and observed that error messages appeared as expected.
6. Used the "Slow-Solve" button to watch the puzzle being solved step by step.
7. Used the "Instant-Solve" button to solve the puzzle immediately.
8. Pressed the "Reset" button to restore the puzzle to its original state.
9. Pressed the "Clear" button to empty the board for custom input.
10. Switched between input mode and normal mode to confirm correct behavior.
11. Observed that the status messages updated appropriately for each action.
12. Ensured that the GUI remained responsive during solving and puzzle generation.
13. Checked that all buttons were enabled and disabled at the correct times (e.g., during solving).
14. Tested edge cases such as a fully filled board, an empty board, and unsolvable boards.
15. Confirmed that the application did not crash or freeze during any operation.
